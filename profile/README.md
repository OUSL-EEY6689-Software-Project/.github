# ELE-SCENT Organization

Welcome to the **ELE-SCENT GitHub Organization**!  
We are a multidisciplinary team of engineering students, wildlife enthusiasts, and researchers working on **AI-powered solutions for elephant conservation**. Our flagship project, **ELE-SCENT**, is an innovative system designed to detect and monitor wild elephants using **odor signatures, IoT, and embedded AI**.
---

## **About ELE-SCENT**
- **Goal:** To reduce human-elephant conflicts (HEC) and accidental deaths (e.g., train collisions) by providing **early detection and alert systems**.
- **Core Technology:** A **IOT** combined with **machine learning models** that recognize elephants.
- **Unique Feature:** A **non-visual, camera-free detection approach** that is resilient to poor visibility, weather, and low-light conditions.

## **Vision & Mission**
### **Vision:**  
To create an **AI-powered, low-cost, and scalable solution** that protects elephants and humans by enabling real-time, non-invasive wildlife monitoring.

### **Mission:**  
- Develop and deploy **VOC-based elephant detection systems** using **IoT and machine learning**.
- Provide **real-time alerts** to wildlife officials and villagers in conflict zones.
- Contribute to **conservation research** by collecting elephant odor datasets for future ecological studies.
